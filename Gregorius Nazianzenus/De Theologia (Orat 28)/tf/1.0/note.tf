7707	12 προστησάμενοι τ. λ.] ’making God the προστάτης, or patron, of the ’;—a favourite expression of Gr's.
20. θη̣ρίον] Ex. xix 13. Cp. Greg. Moral, vi 27 ’bestia montem tangit, cum mens irrationabilibus desideriis subdita ad contemplationis alta se erigit: sed lapidibus percutitur, quia summa non sustinens ipsis superni ponderis ictibus necatur.’
16. ἀμπελῶνες μ] Cant, ii 15 ἀλώπεκας μικροὺς ἀφανίζοντας ἀμπελῶνας. Gr. joins μικροὺς with ἀμπ. instead of ἀλώπ., understanding the sentence to denote the meanness of the ‘foxes’ (i.e. jackals), which did not venture to attack the large vineyeards, and spoiled the small ones instead.
ib. τῇ πέτρᾳ σκεπασθείς] Ex. xxxiii 23 σκ. τῇ χειρί μου. This interpretation of the ‘ cleft in the rock,’ made familiar to Englishmen by ’s hymn, is very ancient. Cp. Iren. IV xx 9 ‘uidebit...in altitudine petrae, hoc est, in eo qui est secundum hominem eius aduentu,’ The Incarnation gives an assured point from which we may observe and study God, without being overwelmed by the greatness of the revelation. The glories of the Divine Nature are tempered for us, as it were, by the Human Life which encompasses us as we look out from it to the Divine. By the Incarnation, our field of contemplation is at once restricted and made clear.
10. σαθραῖς ὄψεσι] Cp. i 3.
17. ἀδυνατώτερον] because if only the conception could be formed, expression would be comparatively easy. Cp. Novatian de Trin. § 4 nomen Dei edici non potest, quolacious. niam non potest nee concipi.
14. κείσθω] ‘be dropped.’ He not wish to pursue the question with regard to the superior intelligences: τὸ δὲ ἠμ’. ‘but as concerning us.’
14. κατεπαρθῇς] ‘exalt yourself against me.’ Cp. Cyr. Al. c. Ful. i p. 6.
15. ταῖς ὄψεσιν] contrasted with τῆ διανοίᾳ: ‘he will pass ἀναδ. because higher up, further back, in the order of thought or causation) to him in thought, although he may not be acquainted with him by sight.’ The unusual pl. ταῖς ὄψ. might mean either ‘by his (the player's) looks,’ or ‘by his (the hearer's) sight.’ latter makes the best parallel to διαν.; it is also used in this sense by Herodian 6 (9, 10) ὡς ἐν ὄψεσιν ἢν ’when he came in sight.’
8. τὸ στόμα...πνεῦμα] Ps. cxviii (cxix) 131. The ἵνα ὥστε, following as it does upon the οὕτως and the τοσούτου.
14. σεπτόν] from σέβεσθαι, ‘an object of devotion.’ Gr. mean that the fact of being περιγραπτόν would by itself preclude being σεπτόν, but that all that is connoted by περιγράπτῳ would.
14. ἀδύνατον] because ‘bodies’ are mutually exclusive.
8. κατὰ τὴν αὐτόνομον κτλ.] Almost each word here requires annotation. Λόγος is ‘the σῶμα,’ or perhaps ἀσώματον σῶμα Φορὰν at first sight seems to refer to τὴν κύκλῳ φ. just above; but there is prob. no such play upon the word intended. Gr. seems to employ it in the sense of ‘usage.’ Although no other example of the subst. in that sense is at hand, the verb is not infrequently so used. Gr. has διὰ γλώσσης φέρειν ‘to speak of. Ἀναπλάττειν and its derivatives are frequent in Gr. Sometimes the prep. has its full force, ‘re-construction,’ ‘fashioning afresh,’ as for ex. baptism; sometimes it is simply ‘to fashion,’ ‘imagine.’ Thus he of matter ὕλην) as ὑποστᾶσαν ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων, κἄν τινες ἀγέννητον ἀναπλάττωσιν. So here he seems to mean the ‘shaping’ which the Aristotelians put upon the word, with a slight suggestion of its being a factitious and not the legitimate construction. This is further expressed by calling it αὐτόνομον, ‘their inderpendent,’ arbitrary, ‘use and construction of the word.’
id. ἐσμός] ‘a swarm,’ said to derived from ἵημι. Ἀλόγιστος= ‘innumerable,’ though its possible sense of ‘irrational’ may perh. have suggested to Gr. the ’abyss of nonsense’ which follows. Στῆναι, ‘to stop.’ is not clear why the notion that God's (supposed) σῶμα is superior to angelic bodies should ‘again introduce a countless swarm of bodies. Perhaps by πάλιν. only means that this notion is in that respect no better than the former one, because it also implies that the angels have bodies. Otherwise he must mean that the supposition of a body far superior to angelic bodies leaves room for the invention of swarms of intermediate bodies between the angelic bodies and it.
ib. τὸ ... παραστῆσαί τε κ. δ.] coupled by ἢ to εἰπεῖν.
19. ἤ] This elliptical and idio- matic use of ἤ suggests the alternative, ‘deny this if you can; or let us take it as self-evident and pass on.’ The μὲν is strictly answered by ἐπεὶ δέ, and there ought not to be such a break between them as is indicated by the usual division of chapters.
7. ἤ τινι, ἢ πανταχοῦ] ‘it must reside either in α section of the universe, or extending throughout the whole: The passage which follows is characterized by Gr. himself (in § 11) as σκολιὸν γριφοειδές. Editors, therefore, and translators may be excused if they have made nonsense of it by wrong punctuation and by impossible renderings. The drift, however, is plain enough. Gr. places his opponent in a dilemma. If the Divine Being is located in a section of the universe, it is circumscribed by something relatively small τοῦ τινός=the supposed section, ἐλάττονος in comparison with τὸ πᾶν); a notion which is manifestly absurd. If on the other hand it is located in the universe at large, yet still (ex hypothesi) within the universe, then, though the thing which circumscribes it is relatively great πλ. καὶ ἄλλου πολλοῦ=‘greater than other great things’), yet none less it is as much circumscribed as in the former case. This follows from the very statement that τὸ θεῖον is ‘in’ the universe, which at once involves the relation of the thing containing to the thing contpined (grammatically τὸ περιεχόμενον is in apposition to the subject of περιγραφήσεται, and τοῦ περιέχοντος to ἐλάττονος τοῦ τινός and to πλείονος respectively). To complete the argument, however, it is necessary to postulate εἰ...μέλλοι) that the universe is not positively infinite but contained within itself if within nothing else, and that as it consists of space-relations it cannot he exempt from the possibility of circumscription. (The grammar of the last clause is apparently irregular, and some word like χρὴ must be supplied from μέλλοι; but it is possible that Gr. intends μέλλοι to stand absolutely and impersonally in both clauses (=‘it is to be a ’), making τό πᾶν περισχ. ace. and inf., like μ. τόπον εἶναι).
ib. ὡς]=ὥστε. The tree is known by its fruits (Matt, vii 20) and the absence of light among the Eunomian theologians by the obscurity of their language.
ib. ἐκ τοῦ κ.ἑ.] a clause epexegetic of τοῦτο.
20. ὃ ἔθετο σκότος] ‘the the darkness which He ’’ etc. Ps. xvii (xviii) 12.
21. σύγκρατόν τε] a curioua use of τε, which is here attached to the whole phrase οὐκ ἁ. σύγκρατον, not merely to σύγκρ., unless we are to suppose that Gr. at first intended to say instead of ἄφετόν τ. οἷον γ., ‘detached from that which generates it, so to speak? some word like σύνδετον, ‘connected with.’
11. τούτων ἀποστ.] The ταῦτα must mean the relative notions which Gr. has shewn to be inseparable from the προσηγορίαι which he has discussed. He cannot mean the προσηγ. themselves, because he goes on to use them as εἰκάσματα. In the next sentence τούτων = τῶν εἰκασ- μάτων.
17. ἐντεῦθεν] sc. διὰ τῆς μεγαλοπρ. τ. ὁρ. Cp. Wisd. xiii 3.
18. θεοῖς ἔτ’.] set gods over them.
20. παραλαβών] i 7 παρ᾿ ἠμῶν. . . λαμβάνει.
15. τὸν εἰρηκότα] ‘him who said it: There is no reason to think that the words which follow are a direct quotation. Nor indeed are the foregoing, but they seem more likely to have had their origin in a reminiscence of something that Gr. had read than the comparatively colourless words which follow. It is harder, however, to say, whom Gr. means by τὸν εἰρ. Elias refers to Oppian Halieut. i 412 οἵῃ σὺν φιλό- διακρίνας ἐκέδασσας αἰθέρα τε, κτλ. Jahn prefers Plato Tim. 35 A foil. The resemblance is not very close; but in Τἰm. 32 c occur words which come somewhat nearer. The ‘body of the world,’ Plato there says, was formed of the various elements δι’ ἀναλογίας ὁμολογῆσαν, φιλίαν τε ἔσχεν...εἰς ταὐτὸν αὑτῷ ξυνελθόν. Perh. Opp. comes the nearer to Gr's language.
19. τῷ οἰκείῳ] ‘with that to wh it belongs’: Vaughan's ‘spirits fair kindred ’ Cp. § 12 sub fin.
ib. ἐπῃνέθη] Perh. Gen. xviii 17 foil.
16. ἢ αὔρα τις ὁ] 1 Kings xix 12 φωνὴ αὔρας λεπτῆς. The τις hints that there was something more than usual in ‘that breeze.’ Gr.’s agrument implies that if the presence had been discerned in the mightier movements of nature, God might have been thought to manifest self wholly in them, but that it was impossible to imagine this in connexion with the ‘small breeze.’
18. τὸ ὄχημα] Ezek. i 4. It is not actually described by that name.
18. δοκιμὴν ἀπ.] 2 Cor. xiii 3.
20. ἀντιλήψεις] From the general notion of ‘catching hold’ of a thing come the opposite meanings of ’helping’ (e.g. 1 Cor. xii 28), and (as here) of ‘objections,’ ‘difficulties.’ Plut. de Def. Orac. (11 438 D) has the expression ὡς ἔχοντα πολλὰς ἀντιλήψεις καὶ ὑπονοίας πρὸς τοὐναντίον.
17. περιγράφει τὸν λ.] ‘He concludes his discourse with astonishment.’
16. μετὰ τῶν πρ.] Intelligence ‘enters in with the things us, because we learn by them. is further expressed by αἰσθ. κοιν.; it is ’in partnership with sense,’ though capable of withdrawing itself from the senses.
13. ὁλκῷ] There seems to be no instance of ὁλκός=ὁλκή, which might mean the flow or current of the river. Suidas gives an interpretation ὁδὸς ἢ ἀγωγὸς ῥεύματος, and quotes the phrase rbv ὁλκὸν τοῦ ὕδατος ἔκοψεν. Here then it would mean ‘as in the channel of a river, which (river) never stands still, yet is ever there.’ This is in accordance with the common meaning of ὁ. = sulcus.
15. ὁ μικρὸς οὗτος κ.] On man as a microcosm, see Plat. Tim. 81 Α and 88 D. These passages have been kindly pointed out to me by Mr Archer-Hind, who adds, “No- thing like the phrase occurs, but the conception is plainly there." He thinks it far from improbable that Proclus, whose commentary on this part of the Tim. has not been pre- served, may have applied the term μικρὸς κόσμος to the human body; or that some Stoic writer so applied it.
18. φιλόκαλα] Gr. seems to be anticipating what he says in § 24 about the peacock; it would not be easy to point to a quadruped which is markedly φιλόκαλον unless Gr. refers to such things as the way in which a cat washes itself. Isocrates advises a man to be φιλόκαλος in regard to his dress, but not καλλωπιστής, which he says would be περίεργον. Ἀκαλ- λώπ. cannot mean ‘unadorned, which would be no antithesis to Φιλόκ., but ‘not given to adorning themselves.’
21. τὰς βιαίους φ.] ’forced notes'; i.e. the unnatural sounds made by birds which are taught to speak and to whistle.
1 ποθεν + δε e || 2 ωστε] ος c || 3 om η bc || 4 καλλωπιζηται] -ζεται bcdf || 6 θεατριζει] -ζη b: -ζειν f || 11 ουρανιων] ουρανων ‘in quibusd.’ 25. 12 φυσικην] φυσιν και f || συνεσιν] κινησιν b ‘tres Colb.’ || 13 λο- γους] + ει δυνασαι df
18. ἑξ. συρ. κ. ἀντιστρ.] ‘by means of hexagonal pipes complementary to each other, and the fabric secured (lit. the firmness is effected) by means of the dividing wall and the combi- nation ὁ the angles with the straight lines.' The ’dividing ’ is perh. the horizontal one between the upper and lower set of cells. But cp. Bas. Hex. viii p. 88 (Paris 1638).
16. ἀπαντῶν] ‘meeting.'
18. ἀλλ. κ. τῇ γῇ συνδ.] It is hard to see what Gr. means by this expression. The bays may be said to be connected with the land by the way they run up into it and affect its whole character. Gr. is no doubt thinking of the deeply indented coast of the Aegean. They are con- nected with each other, apparently, because the coasting vessels pass along from bay to bay, rounding the headlands, and plying between the towns that lie in the gulfs. Cp. ἑ 27.
14. οὐδέ γὰρ ὁ λόγος κτλ.] ‘reason knows of nothing for it (the earth) to rest upon.'
20. παρὰ τῆς γρ.] ’’from Scripture,’ ’by borrowing the words of Scr.’ Job xxvi 10. Γυρῷ, ‘to round.’
16. καθ’ ὁδόν] ’in due order,’ ’methodically’; Plat. Rep. 435 Α.
19. διαθήκης] Gen. ix 12.
20. περιήγαγεν] ’ made it revolve’; cp. § 30.
30. Ἀποσεμν. ‘ to glorify.
18. πρόσλ. τε κ. ἀνθυφ.] ’the increase and corresponding diminution’ of day and night. Ἀνισ. ἰσότης; at the end of the year neither has gained upon the other.
17. τ. κόσμου π.ἀντ] The παντὸς is placed emphatically; the type includes the unseen as well as the seen. Ὁ λόγος, ‘our reason.’ does not refer to any passage of Scripture; it was the traditional interp. of his time. See however Wisd. ix 8 (xviii 24) and cp. West- cott Hebrews p. 237 foil.
14. νόας] ace. pi. of νοῦς.
15. ἴνα μὴ Xeiirrj κτλ.] ‘but that even these first beings after God may never fail Δ’ be the recipients of benefits? They might have seemed too great to receive anything. 18. καὶ οὕτως] Even if he does not speak as well as he wished, has gained his point, viz. to shew that even the angels are beyond our understanding; much more (μὴ  ὅτι, cp. ἑ 11) God Himself.
