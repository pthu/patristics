5160	11. τοῦτο γὰρ μόνον] The verb omitted would prob. have to be expressed by perf. and pres. together; ’have been and are.’ Gr. refers to former outspoken sermons of his such as Orat. XX. For νέαν. cp. i 2.
17. ἀταξία γὰρ μ. λ.] ’Disorder is the prelude to ’For μελέτη (lit. ’practice,’ ’rehearsal’) cp. i 7.
12. ἀφελών κτλ.] Gr. knows no other way of expressing the relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father, such as might get rid of material suggestions.
19. ἔμφασιν] ’an image.’ In order to convey any notion of what is above time, it is impossible to avoid the employment of temporal imagery. Ἔμφασις is, however, used in rhetoric for an innuendo, a sugin gestion of something beyond what the words express; and this may be Gr.'s meaning here.
16. κἀνταῦθα] i.e. ἐν τῷ κτίζειν. Α work of creation (lit. ‘founding’) as known to man involves time in which to work it out, desire for the accomplishment, the formation of a mental ideal, thought as to the mode of execution, etc. Gr.'s objeel is to shew that the thought of creation on ’s part involves as many difficulties as that of generation.
18. κυρίως] ‘properly, because He is not at the same time Son.’ on the other hand, Gr. goes on to say, are not ‘properly ’ fathers, because we are ἄμφω, sons as much as fathers. The variety of our relationships makes it impossible to consider any one of them an exhaustive description of a human being; but fatherhood expresses all that the person of God the Father is.
14. ἴνα τί ἐφρ.] Psalm ii 1.
14. οὐ γὰρ πάθος ἢ β.] This is true; nevertheless it is difficult for the human mind to imagine an act of will which is not caused by something which would come under the description of a πάθος.
15. ἕτερον οἷμαι] Gr.'s argument is not very clear; because the Eunomians also had distinguished very sharply between the will and the person who wills, — so sharply that they said that the Son could not be the Son of one who willed to beget Him, but only of that will itself. But in so arguing they set up a new, though fictitious, identity. They converted the will itself into a personal agency. This is what Gr. combats. Will is one thing, and the person who wills is another. You might as well say that the thing begotten is the son of beget- ting, or trace the thing spoken to speaking instead of the speaker, as thus erect will into a substantive and independent force.
13. τὸ μὲν αὐτοῦ] ‘or did one part of Him will it, while the other part was the result of that will?
19. τὰ μεμερ.] We might have expected μεμερισμένων, ‘belong to soul and body apart’; but it ‘which are the things distributable’ to soul and body respectively.
9. A fresh puzzle is proposed by the Eunomian. Does the Son exist prior to generation, or not? The answer ἲς that there is no such as a time prior to that generation. It is from all eternity. There is no more need to ask whether the Son is ἐξ ὄντων or ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων than there is to ask the same question concerning the Father. We are not compelled to believe that either one or the other of two alternates is true. Take instances. Is time in time or outside of time? A man says, ‘I am lying’: is he speaking the truth or not? Were yon present at your own conception or not? Both alternatives may be false. The question is absurd.
10. εἰ μή σοι κ. ὁ π.] If you still press your question, we will once more ask you about the Father, whether His existence is derived from elements that were beforehand or from elements that were not. Perhaps then you will make out that both propositions are true, and that He has two modes or stages of existence, one before and the other after the absorption of those elements. Or you will choose the latter alternative, and say of Him, as you say of the Son, that He comes into being from nothingness. If you are ready to admit this of the Father (such is the force of the εἰ μή), there is some consistency in what you affirm of the Son.
17. ἠλίθιον] ‘silly.’
14. πῶς οὐ ταὐτόν] llOt ’ III what sense do you ’ for Gr. is not prepared to admit that it is true in any sense ; but simply challenging the statement altogether: ’ how can you say so? if you had said thai created and uncreated are not tin same, I should agree with you, but the transmission of the ’s nature is of the very essence of generation.’
15. οἱ καὶ τὴν ὔ.] The Platonists. Gr. does not adopt their opinion. He only uses it to embarrass the Eunomian. He might have cited in like manner the ’darkness,’ which the Manichees made to be coeternal with light ; but he disdains to do so.
18. εἰ καἰ μέγα κτλ.] If it is a great thing to be altogether underived, as the Father is, it is no less a thing to be derived from Him in the way the Son is. He shares the nature and glory of the Selfexistent, and has the additional glory of being begotten of Him. Cp. iv 7.
12. ἰδιότητος] not ’’personality’ but the special distinguishing peculiarities which differentiate one person from another; the ‘property,’ as Hooker calls it (E. P. v 51). If we enquire at all what the nature of God is, we will do so without touching these individual properties.
No; our belief is, that whatever possesses the essential notes of a class of beings — say of α horse or an ox — is rightly called by that name, whatever distinctive properties it may have which mark it off from others of the class. So it ἲς with God; the nature is one, although there are differences of designation, corresponding to differences hi fact, between the Persons who share that natitre.
17. οὕτω δέ] The ‘apodotic’ force of δέ is well known. It recurs again in the next section.
15. τοιοῦτον εἶδος] ’such a class’; namely, ὁμώνυμα both of which ’properly’ bear the common name.
19. ὁ γραπτός σ. κ. ὁ ζῶν ἆ] The real man and the picture of a man (either of which is spoken of as ’a man’) illustrate more nearly such a Godhead as the Eunomians speak of than the two kinds of ’dogs.’ The picture is not further from being a real man than the Son is from being really God, if the Eunomian account is correct; and at the same time it bears externally a greater resemblance to its original.
11. προσλαβόντες τὴν . . . πρότασιν] ‘taking ὂν their minor premiss. Πρότασις is the tehnical word for a ‘premiss’; the πρός in προσλ. denotes that this is a second (or minor) premiss.
5. τί κωλύει κἀμέ] Two can play at that game, Gr. says. He too can draw that kind of conclusion, and they shall see whether it will hold. He makes a major premiss of that conclusion of theirs, ’The father is by nature greater than the ’ (We need not suppose that Gr. is for the moment speaking of God: the words would suit any father and son.) The minor premiss is, ’But he is not by nature necessarily greater, or necessarily ’ So far there is no absurdity. He need never have had a son; there might have been nothing else to compare him with. (Gr., 1 repeat, is not speaking of God.) The right conclusion would be that the ’s ’natural’ superiority over his son consists solely in his fatherhood, and not in his nature, —in his relationship, and not in that which he is when considered apart by himself. But the false conclusion which Gr. draws, to illustrate the false conclusions of the Eunomians, is this: ’Therefore the greater is not necessarily greater, ’ or ‘The father is not necessarily father.’ It will be observed that Gr. says μεῖζον, not 6 μείζων, which makes it clearer that the proposition is intended to be quite general: Ἁ thing which is greater than another need not be greater, but might be at the same time equal or less; a father need not be his ’s father, but might be his brother or his son.’ The second paralogism ὁ θεὸς οὐ πάντως θεός) helps to shew that this is Gr.'s meaning.
12. ἑτεροούσιον] A word modelled on the false analogy of ὁμοούσιος. It should be ἐτερούσιος.
17. κακομαχεῖν] ‘to fight unscrupulously: The word στροφάς, ’twists,’ shews that the μάχη is a wrestling-match, not a battle.
17. ἔβρεξε κύριος] Gen. xix 24.
not to John xiv 16, which would be little more than a repetition of εὺχήν.
15. τῷ συνθέτω The words which follow — τῷ κενωθέντι κτλ.— as well as ἀσύνθετος in ξ 19, shew that Gr. does not mean ‘to the composite nature,’ sc. the human nature composed of body and soul, but ‘to Him who is composite, made up of two ’ Or possibly, as die τῷ is repealed, Gr. may have intended τῷ συνθέτῳ to be the dat. of τὸ σύνθετον, in the sense of ’the composite whole,’ consisting of Godhead and manhood. It would, of course, have been more exact to have said τῆ διὰ σὲ κενώσει, or something of that kind; but it would have been less vivid; and there was no fear of any one supposing that Gr. meant by τῷ κενωθέντι a different person from Him who had the κρείττω φύσιν.
12. διὰ μέ σου νοός] Cp. Or. ii 23 θεὸς σαρκὶ διὰ μέσης ψυχῆς ἀνεκράθη, καὶ συνεδέθη τὰ διεστῶτα τῆ πρὸς ἄμφω τοῦ μεσιτεύοντος οἰκειότητι. In Or. xxxviii, after shewing in § 10 how creatures endowed with mind have an affinity with God which other creatm-es have not, Gr. says in § 13 that the Eternal Word was incarnate διὰ μέσης ψυχῆς νοερᾶς μεσιτευούσης θεότητι καὶ σαρκὸς παχύτητι. We cannot imagine an ’incarnation ’ of the Word in an irrational thing.
11. ὐπ’ ἀγγ. ἐδοξάσθη] Luke ii 9 f.
19. ὑπὸ δαιμ. ἐπιγινώσκεται] Mark i 24, 34 etc.
19. ἐξουσίαν ἐχ.] John x 18.
ib. τὸ το̣ῦ πνεύματος ἀ̣ξ.] ’defeat the credentials of the Spirit by our contentions.’
