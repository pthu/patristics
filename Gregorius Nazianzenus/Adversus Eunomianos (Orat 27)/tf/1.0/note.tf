2186	5.βεβ. κενοφ. κτλ.] Ι Tim. vi 20; 2 Tim. ii 16 ; cf. 1 Tim. vi 4 and 2 Tim. ii 14.
10. ὅ τι δήσ. ἢ λῦσ’. τ. προβ.] ’They care for nothing but the opportunity of tying or untying some knotty proposition.‘
15. σπαρ. τὰ αὶσο.] Jer. iv 19 (LXX.).
19. τὸ μετριώτατον] ‘to say the least of ’ For the thouglht, cp. Athan. de Inc. § 57.
14. ἕξις] appears to mean skill,’ ’ acquired power.’
14. κοιταζόμενον κτλ.] Deut. vi 7 (cp. xi 19).
15. ἐπιβάτην] more usually signifies ’ a rider ’ ; but here the metaphor is probably taken from a chariot race, and ἐπιβ. will mean ’ the man in the ’ i.e. the driver. The word is elsewhere used in a more restricted sense, of the man who fights in a chariot, not the driver; but it is evidently not so intended here.
11. δόγμασιν] ‘ received ’ ; used of heathen beliefs in general, — possibly of the doctrines of heathen philosophers in particular.
6. The heathen world, with its base mythology, is not in a ?? to understand the niceties of Christian v. It must inevitably attach unworthy meanings to the phraseology which it hears us use.
13. φίλ’. ἐν τοῖς ἡμετέροις] τοῖς ἤμ’. is prob. neuter, ‘ in our quarters ’ ’ in our ’; but it may be masc., ‘ among our ’ In either case, of course, it means, ’to adopt and use our system of ’ The term φιλοσοφία was early applied to Christianity. See Melito ap. Eus. Hist. Eccl. iv xxvi 7 ἢ καθ’ ἡμᾶς φιλοσοφία.
12. γλωσσαλγία] Α classical word for ‘talkativeness,’ much used by Gr.
15. διὰ τῶν θυρίδων] Jer. ix 21. The same interpretation is given by Greg. Nyss. de Dom. Οrat. v, by Ambrose de Fuga Saec. ἑ 3 and in Psalm, cxuiii Exp. vi ἑ 20, and by Jerome adv. Jovin. II p. 202 (Mart.). It became the traditional interpretation. Cp. Greg. Moral, xxi 2 ; Bern. in Cant. 24.
14. ἐκεῖθεν] ‘on yonder side.’
14. διὰ τοὺς ἰδρ. κτλ.] because of the effort it demands, and because few are found able to tread it, in comparison of the great number who take the contrary direction, and who walk in the way of vice. The καὶ couples the antecedent of ὅσοι to τῶν ἐναντίων.
11. ὠτῶ δέ· ὁ. σὺ] Assuming that you have the gifts which you imagine, why do you make such a bad use of them ? In ὑψ. πέρα it is doubtful whether ὑψ. is neut. or masc., ’beyond the heights ,’ or 'be- yond the high ones.’
9. 1 και ο μετα] και μετα c || 6 om υφασμασιν ad ‘duo Reg. duo Colb. Or. 1’
ib. οἱ μ....τ. γίγαντας] Α contracted expression; ‘as the old fables did with the giants,’ meaning, ‘as the old fables said that the Earth brought forth the giants.’ It the metaphor of ἀνάδοσιν. The giants, however, are referred to not only because they sprang out of the Earth, but because they waged war upon the gods.
ib. τὴν σιωπήν] “The Pythagorean school is represented to us not merely as a scientific association, but also, and principally, as a religious and political society. Entrance into it was only to be obtained by a strict probation, and on condition of several years’ silence." “The duration the silent noviciate is variously given.’’ Zeller Pre-Socratic I p. 342 (Engl. Transl.), where this ref. of Gr. may be added to those given by Zeller.
5. ἐπὶ ψυχήν] ‘directed to,’ as far as,’ and so ‘ concerned the soul,’ i.e. of the beloved, it may profess to be unconcerned with the body. "Love...is realised in a graduated series of different forms. The first is the love of beautiful shapes,—of one, and then of all: higher step is the love of beautiful souls, which operates in moral words and efforts, in works of education, art, and legislation: a third is the love of beautiful sciences," etc.: Zeller p. 194; cp. Ρ. 507.
7. θεαγωγίας, ψυχ.] ‘the calling up of gods, and of souls.’
