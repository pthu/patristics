6540	ib. ἐπὶ τῶν ὁδῶν evp. ἐ.] Roads and rivers sometimes divide, and then the divergent portions inert again lower down. So here, people differ on most points but agree on others, so that you never can be sure where they agree and where they are at issue.
13. μαρτυριῶν] ’ the texts that bear upon the investigation.’
ib. ἐντεῦθεν] explained by the clause τὰς αὐτὰς . . . ἐφαρμόζοντες.
4. There never was α time when He was not. No one person of the Trinity can be imagined to exist or to have ever existedwithoutthe others ; for an imperfect Godhead is unthinkable; able; especially a Godhead holiness. If He ever began to exist, He is on a level with us. How could He raise us, as He does, to Godhead?
15. διειλήφαμεν] ’ have discussed’; cp. iv 16.
16. διέστησαν] 1st aor., ‘ they put them at such a distance from each other, as to make the first’ etc.
13. ἐνέργεια τοῦτο ἂν εἴη θ.] ‘it (the Holy Spirit so conceived of) will be an operation of God’— an influence, an inspiration, or the like—‘for what else could it be, or from whom besides could it come?’
7. Now it is your turn. ‘Is He begotten, or unbegotten? If begotten, of whom ? If of the Father, there are two Sons; if of the Son, He is a grandson.’ Your names do not terrify me. Because we are obliged to speak of ‘Sonship’ in the Godhead, it does not follow that all earthly nomenclature would apply; or at that rate you will have to say ali manner of strange things.
20. εἰ δέ σοι κ· τοῦτο π·] ’and if you like to carry the gamt farther i cp. iii 7 προσπαιξω τὸν π.
15. ἐκεῖθεν] from such a source as the Father.
19. ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐλλ. τ. ποθεν] ’but this language does not indicate a in any direction, nor the inferiority of essence.' The ταῦτα not refer only to what has immediately preceded, viz. that the Father is not Son ; this would not suggest any thought of ὕφεσις. It refers also to the ’s not being Father, nor the Spirit Son.
12. δὸς οὖν μοι] The word διδόναι is not used here in its frequent sense of a logical concession ; for it would be no concession to the Eunomians to ’give’ what is here required. It means rather, ’shew me’ ‘convince me that it is so.’ The Eunomian offers, if convinced that two consubstantial persons issue from the same Divine Source, to acknow- ledge each of them to be a God. Gr. illustrates the illogical character of the offer by a counter-paralogism. ‘Shew me,’ he says, ‘that there is than one sort of God, and I will shew you the same Trinity that we now believe in, name and thing.’ It is as unreasonable to deduce ditheism or tritheism from the Catholic doctrine of the relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father, as it would be to deduce the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity from a belief in Godheads of varying quality.
19.δαπανώμενον] ‘consumed,’ cp. iv 6. The ref. of course is to the phoenix (Herod, ii 73); see Lightfoot's note on Clem, ad cor. § 25. Gr. himself evidently does not quite believe the fable.
17. οὐ γὰρ τοῦ ἑνός] This is part of the objection, not of Gr.’s reply. From the one person of the Father, they say, there cannot issue two others, one by generation, the other in some other way.
19. προσεύξ. τῷ πν.] I Cor. xiv 15.
19. μετὰ σεαυτοῦ] Cp. § 4 μετ’ ἐμοῦ.
14. τί φατε] ‘What do you say to us Tritheists?’ i.e. What argument can you urge against us, whom you call Tritheists, which will not equally apply to yourselves, who worship the Son, even if you have departed from the Spirit?
15. τὸ μὲν μᾶλλον] The Benedictine editors compare Leo Serm. viii in Nat. Chr. ‘gradus in uera diuinitate esse non possunt. quidquid deo minus est, deus non est.
13. μόνον ἐπινοίᾳ θ.] In the case of the heathen polytheism, the common Godhead exists only as a conception or generalisation of the philosopher; it has no existence in fact. Each individual deity differs greatly from the other in history, and character, and capacities. The same holds true of the specimen man in relation to the human genus.
16. φάνητας] “A mystic in the Orphic rites, representing the first principle of the world, cf. Orph. Arg. 15 ” (Lidd. and Sc).
18. τὰ ὀμ. συναριθμεῖται] Things of the same nature, like men, trees, or horses, come under a number which sums them up, as three trees, four horses, five men ; you cannot, acc. to the disputant, apply them to heterogeneous things, and class a tree, a horse, and a man together as being three. Cp. Bas. de Sp. S. 17.
18. ἄλλως] carries on the irony of ἀρχαίως, ἀμαθῶς. It is used in the idiomatic sense of ‘idlt,’ ‘vainly.’
16. οἷς συνεκφ. καταλλ. κ. τ. ὀ.] The opponent explains that things ranged under a number, because they are of the same nature. he means cases where the noun is expressed and the numeral agrees with it (oἷς i.e. συναριθμουμένοις practically = ‘ the numeral’), like ‘three men,’ ‘three God.’ He does not mean that you can never lump together under a neuter numeral heterogeneous objects as so many ‘things.’ This, he says, is not a connumeration.
13. μὴ καταλλ. ἔχων ἀπ’. ] he coines forward without putting his words in grammatical agreement.’ ᾿Αρρενικῶς, ‘in the ’; οὐδετέρως, ‘in the meut.’
17. προαριθμ. κ. ὑπαριθμ.] Elias says, probably without historical grounds, that this system of numbering (δεύτερος θεός, τρίτος θεός) was derived from the way in which the Neoplatonic writers arranged existences according to a scale, from the First Cause to the lowest. The phraseology is fully discussed by Basil l. c. (de Sp. S. 17.)῾Υπαριθμεῖν’, as distinguished from συναριθμ., is to reckon in a secondary position.
21. You speak of the silence of Scripture on the Godhead of the Ghost. Scholars have often shown hoto false this is; but I too will do my best to help you out of your difficulty.
15. λύσομεν…βλάβην] ‘will remove this disadvantage’; said a kind of irony, as if the opponent would recognise that it was a βλάβη.
19. τὸ δέ ὀξυκ.] more instances of metaphorical language. God ‘flies,’ Ps. xvii li (xviii 10); we speak of His ‘face,’ e.g. Ps. iv 7 (6); His ‘hand,’ e.g. Ps. cxliv (cxlv) 16.
8. τῶν ὀνομάτων] sc. ἀγέννητον, ἄναρχον.
24. This being so, we must not make too much of the reticence Scripture. When you hear of twice five, you are justified in saying ten ; so whatever is clearly implied in Scripture may rightly be affirmed, even if it is not explicitly stated there. I will give you the reason for the reticence of Scripture.
17. ταύτας] the προσηγορίαι of the Spirit.
15. τὸ μὲν τοῦ βίας.] In the one instance, the change would be the work of him who forced it on ; in the other, it is our own. The one kind of change is in keeping with the the considerateness of God ; the other would be a mark of tyrannical power.
16. ἐγὼ δέ, ἀδελφοί] Gal. v. 11. Probably Gr. does not mean that this was an advance in St Paul’s views. He can hardly have failed to know that the Ep. to the Gal. was written before the incident in Acts xxi 26. He only means we see St Paul sometimes acting on the principle of οἰκονομία, i.e. departure from what is absolutely best, out of consideration for the circumstances of others, and sometimes on the principle of τελειότης.
ib. προόδοις] Cp. ii 20.
ib. εἶτα, Ἥξει] John xvi 7 (ἔλθῃ). Here the Spirit’s own freedom brought out. It is a correct and useful observation.
16. εἴπερ τι μέγα οἴ. χρὴ] ‘if we may call anything which is promised or taught great.’ It implies a of appreciation, greater than we perhaps possess, to determine the degrees of greatness in what God promises or reveals.
14. ἢ χρυσῆ τις] in rough apposition to ἐν. It is difficult to decide between this reading and χρυσῖτις, which has the authority of the best MS. The pronuntialion being identical, it seems natural to choose the rarer word ; but on the other hand the scribe of ‘a’ may have been thrown out by the somewhat unusual combination of ἢ with τις. Cp. ii 19 ἢ αὔρα τις ὀλίγη.
12. ἰδιότητας] as in § 28.
13. δάκτυλος θ.] Luke xi 20 compared with Matt, xii 28 ; πῦρ, Acts ii 3 (cp. 1 Thess. v 19, 2 Tim. i 6); ὡς θεός, Hob. xii 29.
10. νοερὸν κτλ.] The following list is taken from Wisd. vii 22 foll., which describes the ‘spirit’ which ‘is in Wisdom.’ Gr. does not all the epithets there used, some of which, esp. μονογενές, would have been troublesome for him to expound. Each epithet from νοερὸν to ἀμόλυντον is explained. Νοερόν = σοφώτατον ; πολυμερές = ταῖς ἐνεργ. ; σαφές = σαφηνιστικὸν πάντων (neut.) ; τρανόν = τρανωτικόν ; ἀκώλυτον = αὐτεξούσιον (this shews the order of df to be wrong) ; ἀμόλυντον = ἀναλλοίωτον (since change in the Holy Ghost must be a change for the worse).
15. πόρρω τοῦ πν] like ἀλλότριοι τοῦ πν. in § 29, ‘unspiritual.’
15. ὀφθαλμόν] The context makes it unquestionable that Elias is right in interpreting the word to mean what is called ὀπή in James iii 11, — the ‘mouth’ out of which the spring issues. No other example of this usage seems to be known; but Gr.’s own language in his poem about the Holy Ghost (iii 60) leaves no room for doubt. He there rejects the same comparison of πόρος, πηγή, ποταμὸς μέγας, ἐν τε ῥέεθρον. It is just possible that Gr. was aware that an ‘eye’ is the ordinary word in Hebrew for a spring; but in any case the metaphor is so natural that it is prob. an accident that we do not find it oftener.
11. κἀνταῦθα δέος] This illustration likewise had its dangers. It might have suggested that the Trinity is a Trinity by some kind of composition or combination, such as the science of Gr.’s time between the su itself and the ray and the light which were ‘in’ the sun. Cp. Or. xliv 4. And secondly there was the opposite danger of suggesting that the Father alone has true positive being, while the Son and Spirit are but faculties of His, without personal subsistence, such being in Gr.’s view the character the ray and the light.
8. μαρμαρυγήν τινα] The illustration, tration, though attractive to the poetical imagination of Gr., is not immediately clear. It seems at first as if the trinity were the sunbeam, the water, and the wall, which combine to produce the παλμός, the dancing and quivering reflexion. The point, however, appears to lie rather in the junction of unity with multiplicity (the number three being for the moment lost sight of) displayed in the vibrations of the sunbeam.
12. τὴν διάνοιαν ἵστησιν] ῾nothing to satisfy my mind (lit. which brings it to a stop) when I contemplate illustrations the image which I form.’
