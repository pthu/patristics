5189	ib. θεῷ παθητῷ] a daring oxymoron. Gr. would of course deny that the Godhead of Christ was subjected to suffering, though the Divine Person was so subjected, in virtue of the nature which He assumed.
14. οἱ οὐρανοί] ’s. xviii 2 (xix Ι).
15. ἀλήθεια κ. κρίσις] Ps. ex (cxi) 7. These, which are the works of our salvation τοῦ σωθῆναι π. ἡμᾶς), are identified as ’the works’ with view to which Wisdom was ‘created.’
8. ἐδοὑλ. σαρκί] Gr. seems to be undecided whether to take πολ. λοῖς as neut., including σάρξ, λένεσις, πάθη, or as masc, viz. πᾶσιν οἶς κτλ. The ’Attic attraction’ οἶς misled De Billy into supposing that πᾶσιν likewise was neut. (omnibus illis per quae). It is difficult to determine whether the same mistake caused the copyists to write κατεχομένους, or whether Gr. himself neglected to complete the attraction by saying (as he should have done) κατεχομένοις. That Ue ’s translation is wrong is shewn by the absence of the article before κατεχομένους; if Gr. had meant ’and all those things whereby He hath saved those who were enslaved,’ he have said τοὺς κάτεχ’. In view of the preponderating authority for κατεχομένους, it seems best to retain it in the text, understanding it to be a construction ad sensum, agreeing with the οὓς which lies hidden in the attracted ὄις.
13. τὴν ἐκ δεξίων κ.] Ps. cix (ex) 1.
16. ἵσταται θ. ἐν μ. θεῶν...διακρίνων] Ps. lxxxi (lxxxii) 1.
17. ὂ κ. πρ. εἴπομεν] ἑ 3 sub fin.
17. τῶν). ὒ. χεῖρα τ.] The apart from the Incarnation, was neither obedient nor disobedient. Such language applies only to subjects and inferiors. Τὸ μέν, sc. ὑπήκοος; τὸ δέ, ἀνῆκ’.
14. τὸ φῶς...σκοτίᾳ] John i 5.
11. οὐχ ὁ π.] Gr. will not allow that ὁ θεὸς here = ὁ πατήρ, as otherwise it would suggest that the Son is ’resolved’ again into Him, in Sabellian fashion, — like a brand snatched for a time out of a great burning pile and then joined to it again.
15. γεννάδαι] iron, ’these fine gentlemen.’
14. τοῦ κ. θεοῦ θεός] He ἲς τοῦ κυρίως θεοῦ θεός : not however in virtue of the ’s Godhead, but because ὁ κυρίως θεός is also man.
8. 3 εχει] εχον c || θεος] + ο θεος e2 || 6 ηνικα] + ἀν b
ib. λαμβάνειν] ζωήν John v 26; κρίσιν ib. 22, 27 ; κληρ. ἐθνῶν Ps. ii 8; ἐξ. π. σαρκός John xvii 2; δόξαν in the context seems to point to John xvii 1, 5, but cp. 1 Pet. i 21, 2 Pet. i 17; μαθητάς John xvii 6.
17. οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ ν.] Mark ii 19.
ib. ῥαφίς] Matt, xix 24, 26.
ib. βλέπει δὲ...πῶς λ́τλ.] ‘ In what sense docs He see the Father doing, and do likewise?’
20. ἕως ἄρτι] John v 17.
10. ὡς παρὰ τοῦ ἁ.] ‘that the expression took this form as proceeding from the Man (see note on § 7), not from the Saviour regarded αἰ such.’
16. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ λέγ.] From the illustrations which Gr. proceeds to give, it seems clear that the phrase ἀπὸ κ. is used without any ref. to τὸ κοινόν immediately before. With the possible exception of the first, they have nothing to do with the peculiar ‘ community ’ which exists between the Father and the Son. We must therefore suppose that ἀπὸ κοινοῦ is an adverbial expression with a wider meaning. It is, however, difficult to seize the exact force of it. Elias appears to have thought that it meant ’ in α way that common intelligence discerns.' It prob. means ’in a general way,' as distinguished from a pedantic adaptation to special situations. Cp. κατὰ κοινοῦ § 13.
9. eh οὑν ἀποκατ.] Gr. adds this gloss, because in one sense unbelievers also have an ἀνάστασις.
18. οὐκ ἀπολεῑ] ‘How can He help losing?’
19. οὗτός σου θεός] Baruch iii 35 foll.
16. μετὰ τοῦ σώματος] Gr. to mean ’with the Church.’ Μετὰ would not be a very natural prep. to use of the other ’body.’
15. ὁ π. τῶν αἰώνων] II Heb. i 2. In συντελεστὴς Gr. peril, refen to sach passages as Epb. i 10, or iv 13; in μεταπ., to Rev. xxi 5 (although the Speaker there is the Father) or Wisd. vii 27 ; in τὸ πέρας, to Rev. i 17 etc., or Col. i 16 εἰς αὐτόν). The question only asks how such an one could be ignorant of anything ; but the titles by which He is here spoken of have ref. to this particular thing.
12. τὸ γὰρ ἀπόλυτον κτλ.] The γὰρ justifies the assertion εὔδηλον. ‘ For the fact that the title of " the Son " stands absolutely and without conditions, nothing being added to say whose Son, suggests to us this interpretation ; so that we put the more reveiwit construction tipon the ignorance, and attribute it to the human nature, not to the divine.' Ἄσχετον is used in a remarkable way, as if from σχέσις, ‘ ’ In the light of later criticism, the fact which Gr. notices may be thought to tell in the opp. direction : the absolute title seems to denote the eternal relation, not the temporary condition. See ’s note in his St Mark p. 297. Gr. takes the argument, as well as the illustrations of τεῖχος, νύξ, from Ath. οἱ. iii c. Ar. § 43, who says that if it had stood ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, it would have implied that the Godhead did not know, but that ὁ υἱός allows us to suppose that the ignorance is that τοῦ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων γενομένου υἱοῦ.
12. τὸ συναγόμενον] Cp. § 12. The rgument is not very clear ; but the ὡς δῆλον appears to give the reason, not for the Son's knowing, but for the Son's knowing it from the Father. Nothing but the πρώτη φύσις can know, therefore the incarnate Son could not obtain the knowledge in any other way than from the Father.
21. ὅσον εἰκ. ἔδοσαν] We are not directly informed what was the original purpose of the custom to which Gr. is about to refer ; we can only conjecture.
15. ἐκ τῶν ἡμ. ἐφικτῶν] sc. ὀνομάτων.
14. ἴδιον ὄντως θεοῦ] so ἐστίν. What we are in quest of, we find in the name ὁ ὤν ; for τὸ ὂν is the special property of God, and belongs to Him in its entirety, not partially, as it does to other beings, who only have a share in existence. It is a little surprising that Gr. does not say τὸ δὲ εἶναι, instead of τὸ δὲ ὄν. Perhaps it is because he has used τὸ εἶναι immediately before in a somewhat different sense (viz. of what a thing is, rather than that it is) ; and whereas τὸ εἶναι represents existence as a purely conceptual thing, τὸ ὂν represents it as actually existing, and so is better suited to denote the fulness of the divine nature.
ib. ἢ Ἀβραάμ κτλ] Ex. iii 6.
20. He is the Son, Only begotten, Word, Wisdom, Power, Truth, Image, Light, Life, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption, Resurrection.
ib. εἰκών] 2 Cor. iv 4, Col. i 15.
14. καὶ πνοήν...καὶ πν.ἅγ.] Gen. ii 7, John xx 22. Ἐκεῖθεν in the same way as at the beginning of the § All of us have received from Him the ‘ breath of life ’ ; as many as are capable of it have received the Holy Spirit, in measure proportioned to our receptivity.
ib. τοῦ τε ὑπὲρ ἡμ.] It would be quite in keeping with Gr.'s usage to make the τοῦ masc., ’Him who is above us and Him who came to be what He is for our sakes'; cp. § 7. But perhaps we may give Gr. the benefit of the doubt and take the word as neut., as it is below.
ib. ποιμήν] John x 11.
17. ἐκεῖνο] viz. the text Ἰησοῦς X. κτλ. ; Heb. xiii 8. Gr. ends with something of a ’riddle,’ in order to fix his teaching in the memory. The words from Ἰησοῦς to σωματικῶς form the subject ; ὁ αὐτὸς πν. is the predicate. The interpr. which Gr. has just put upon the title χριστός must be borne in mind. He seems to take χθ. κ. σῆμ’ closely together, in the sense of ’recently ,' ’during these last few days,' — not, of course, like πρώην τε καἰ χθές, excluding the present, but including it. With σωματικῶς cp. Col. ii 9; the adverbs have no verbs to qualify, unless ὤν or ὑπάρχων be supplied. For πνευματικῶς = νοουμένας see WestCOtt on Heb. ix 14. The sentence is therefore: ’Jesus, anointed with the whole indwelling Godhead, who now for a few days has been in bodily form, is, considered according to the inward principle of His being, the same unchanged personality that He was before His incarnation, and will be so for ever.’
