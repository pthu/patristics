2 Eusebius assumes that the census mentioned Josephus, which led to a revolt, is the same as that refe to in Luke and in Acts. If he be right Luke and Matt cannot be reconciled, for the census of Quirinius referred to by Josephus and also in Acts v. 37 was in A.D. 6. Sir W. Μ. Ramsay thinks that there may have been an earlier census in the reign of Herod during a former governorship οf Quirinius in Syria, which did not then include the domain οf Herod. There is good evidence for tbe former governorship of Quirinius, but none for a census in Judaea during his goveernorship by (or for) Herod. see Eusebius, Ecl. proph. 158 ff.

2 Eusebius reckons the baptism οf Christ as taking place in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, dating his accession from the death of Augustus. As be was then in his thirtieth year he was born in the forty-second year of Augustus, fourteen years before his death. This is the reckoning of time known as the Christian era (see p. 46).

1 Eusebius has slightly altered the text οf Josephus. This ran : “ For Herod killed him, a good man and one who commanded the Jevs training thembelves in virtue and practising righteousness towards one another and piety towards God to together for baptism.” It would seem mean that John was preaching to ascetics and suggested baptism as a hnal act of perfection. This explains the reference to “ when the rest collected.” So long as preached to ascetics Herod did not mind but was disturbed when the rest οf the public manifested interest. Whiston's translation of Josephus and an unnecessary emendation in the text of Niese's edition of Josephus have conspired to obscure these fficts.

1 Schwartz prefers the reading οf BD, ὧν ἐπέγραψεν, but to make scnse this would require the article τῷ before δευτέρῳ. It is possible that the τῷ slipped out by a primitive error, in which case ὧν would be the better reading.

1 The feast was probably that pro salute Caesaris which waS celebrated every four years (see Ε. Schwartx, “ Ζur Chronologie des ” ött. Nachr. 1907), and was duc in Α.D. 44 Wben Herod probably died. 2 Note that Eusebius uses the word λόγιον of the Acts: iu view of the fact that the word, literally “ ” is generally used of the Οld Testament it might almost be rendered by “Scripture.”

1 Eusebius is usually very accurate in his quotations, but here he varies from the tert of Josephus, who says “ he saw an owl sitting on a certain rope over his head, and at onee understood that it was a messenger ἄγγελος) of evil, as it had formerly been οf ” The allusion is to the story that when Αgrippa, at the loweSt ebb of his misfortunes, was in prison ln Rome he saw an οwl and regarded it as a harbinger οf better days, whieh did indeed soon come (Josephus, Ant. xviii. 6. 7).

1 Ιt is remarkeable that Fusebius did not notice that this Theudas of Αctṣ̣ is the Theudas or Josephus and explain the speecb as literary faction. Some think that “ Luke ’’ was misled by Josephus, who happens to mention Theudas in the same context as Judas of Galilee.

1 Ιn the curiou mixture οf philosophical language with mythological concepts which characterized the theology of the Graeco-Roman world of the first four centuries after Christ, the word here translated “ idea ’’ was one of those used of the various beings proceeding from the original godhead, and bridging as it were the gap between and Creation.

l The tradition is obviously confused. Oblias may be an inaecurate transliteration οf the Ηebrew for “ Rampart of the People," but the reference to the prophets defies explanation. The “ Gate” οf Jesus is also a puzzle, but it may be connected with the early Christians’ name for themselves of “ the Way."

2 This story is confused and improbaable. The text of Hegerippus must be corrupt, for Rechabim is only the Hebrew plural and merelyl repeats the previous phrase. Μoreover the rechabites were a tribe οf Kenites who ere adopted into israel (cf. 1 Chron. ii. 55 and Jer. XXXN. 19). There is no evidence that a Rechabite was ever counted as a Levite, or that the name was that of a sect to which a priest οr Levite could have belonged. Epiphanius (Haer. lxxviii. 14) replaces this mysterious Rechabite by Simeon the son of Clopas.

1 The point appears to be that the settlement of the lady's estate meant an accounting to her by her husband, and probably cosiderable payment by him to her, so that the situation was that if he wished to gratify his grudge against her he would have to pay more than he desired, while if she wished to escape a martyr's crown she must sacrifice some οf property to her husband. Justin's point of view is obvious, but the emperor may have thought that wives who refused to join in their husband's amusemenb Scarcely deserved to be executed yet might Well pay for the privilege of having failed to convert their husbands to their own vay or thinking.

1 It appears to have been some time before the Church adopted the Lenten fast of forty days. Oddly enough, according to the historian Socrates (Hist. Eccl. v. 22) the Greek name for Lent (τεσσαρακοστή=fortieth) is oldcr thc custom of fasting forty days. Forty hours was the traditional interval between the death and resurrection οf Jcsus. Thc present limits οf Lent appear to have been Rxed in the seventh century. see ’s Dictionary ὁ Christian Antiquities, s.v. Lent.
2 The meaning appears to be that the previous generation of Romans had not nlade an issue οut οf the Quartodeciman practiee, even whcn Asiatics visiting Rome observed it. The difficulty can be seen best if it be remembered that the Quartodeciman praetice would sometimes mean that Asiatics treated as Easter day what the Romans regarded as Good Friday.
1 Commodus was killed οn December 31, A.D. 192.Pertinax ucceeded him, but was killed by the Praetorian guard οn Μarch 28, 193.

2 Apparently the meaning οf the passage is that these persons tried to introduce Greek learning generally into the interpretation of scripture. Though little noted at the time or since, their rejection by the Church is perhaps one οf the turning-points οf history.
