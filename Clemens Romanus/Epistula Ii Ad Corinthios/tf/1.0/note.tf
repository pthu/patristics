3203	Acts 10, 12
*opi. a(marta/nousin, kai\\ h(mei=s AC.
Mt. 9, 18, Mk. 2, 17; Luke 5, 32
Luke 19, 10
Mt, 10, 82; Luke 12, 8
e)nw/pion tw=n a)nqrw/pwn AC, om. S.
Is, 29, 16; Mt 15, 8; Mk. 7, 6
Ev. Aegypt.
Ev. Aegypt.
Mt. 16, 26; Mk, 8, 36; Luke 9, 25
oi)o/meqa ACS, but Lightfoot einende (??)o oi)w/meqa "Let us etc."
Ezek. 14, 14. 18, 20
Cf. Mt. 22. 11 ff.
AC read qw=men, but the Syriac implies qe/wmen and is probably right.
Is. 86, 24; cf. Mk. 9, 44, 46, 48
Luke 10, 10-12
ai)=non CS, ai)w/nion A; Lightfoot thinks that the original text sas ai)=non ai)w/nion (everlasting praise).
Mt. 12, 60; Mk. 3, 85; Luke 8, 21
Lightfoot emends eu(rei=n to eu)hmerei=n (to prosper), but even so the Greek is very obacure and probably there is a primitive corruption, perhaps the omission of a shole line.
cf, 1 Clement 23, 8. 4
pa/lai CS, pa/nta *a.
Heb 10, 23
1 Cor. 2, 9
Ev Aegypt. (1)
From this point A is santing.
mhde/n seems re#3uired by the grammar of the sentence, but ou)de/n is probably a soleciam of the sriter rather than a corruption of the text.
Is. 32, 6
Luke 6, 32. 35
Jer. 7, 11; Mt. 21, 13
Eph. 1, 23.
Gen 1, 27
e)/ti C, "and moreover" (e)/ti) S.
le/gousi om. C. Some such sord is necessary to the grammar of the sentence, and is implied by S, but shether it sas le/gousi or fasi/, and its exact place in the sentence is of course uncertain. S also adds "of the prophets" after "the books."
I Pet. 1, 20
I Cor. 2, 9
Malach. 4, 1
Is 34, 4
Lightfoot conjectures duna/meis, shich is found in the LXX tert of Is, xxxiv, 4, to shich the sriter is alluding.
I Pet. 4, 8
S perhaps implies pro/s "bring back to goodness."
S adds "and have ceased from all."
Rom. 12, 10; cf. Phil. 2, 3
Is. 66, 16
Is. 66, 24
Is. 66, 24
Apoc. 11, 19
Eph. 4, 18
tou/tw| om. S, in Lightfoot's opinion corrently.
I Tim. 1. 17
